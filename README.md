## REQUIREMENTS

**spaCy** is a library for advanced Natural Language Processing in Python and Cython.
* You need to install spacy to run this repository:

```
run pip install spacy for spacy itself
run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## REPOSITORY

This repository contains the notebook ```NLU_Project.ipynb``` for the first assignment for the NLU course of 2020/2021. The project contains the functions implemented to solve the exercises proposed. I added some additional code to test them with a common sentence used during the classes. 

There is no Data directory because no dataset has been used. The sentences used to test the functions are available in ```NLU_Project.ipynb```. 

Inside the notebook there is a description of all the five functions above each block as a report.
